Similarly named files are modified version of each other.

For AFD imaging, analysis were done..
Ca_response_calc_cell_body -> baseline_correct_universal_AT -> plot_multiple_calcium_heatmap_AT (to make heatmaps) OR find_T_star_linear_AT

For AIY imaging,
Ca_response_calc_neurite -> baseline_correct_universal_AT -> plot_multiple_calcium_heatmap_AT (to make heatmaps)
